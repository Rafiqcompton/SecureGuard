Unit Tests: Create a tests directory within your repository. Inside that directory, create a file named test_secureguard.py. Implement unit tests in this file to test the functionality of the SecureGuard library.

Continuous Integration: Within the .github/workflows directory, create a file named ci.yml. Configure this file to define a workflow for continuous integration. This can include steps such as installing dependencies, running unit tests, and checking code quality.

Contribution Guidelines: Create a file named CONTRIBUTING.md to provide guidelines for contributing to the SecureGuard library. Include information on how to submit pull requests, code style conventions, and any other relevant information.

Code of Conduct: Create a file named CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to outline the expected behavior and guidelines for contributors and maintainers of the SecureGuard library.

Note that the above additions are hypothetical and provided as an example. You can tailor them to fit your project's needs.
